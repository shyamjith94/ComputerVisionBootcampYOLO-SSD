# Algorithm output

added working video file download zip or clone repo and see

# Face detection

real time face detection using viola james algorithm fail in some orientation


# SVM LinearSVC
classification human and non-human faces data be used fetch_lfw_people from sklern

# YOLO Algorithm

classification and detection of human face and cars from images and video\
using VGG16 so size is large\
using config and weight file yolo 320\

# SSD algorithm

yolo using mobile net 23x smaller than VGG16
Trained by coconet data set 90 classes
